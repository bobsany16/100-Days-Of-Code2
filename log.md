React lessons

**Thoughts:** Trying to re-establish a healthy sleep/work-schedule has been hard but I believe I'll make it happen

### Day 84: ###

**Progress:** In an attempt to learn more about React components, I decided to create a mock design of my.sbu.edu. 

**Thoughts:** Skeleton created, now I just need to go on and populate the site.

### Day 85: ###

**Progress:** Made some stylings in mySBUMock via module.css and global.css files. 

**Thoughts:** Stylings in React is a bit weird for me, it'll probably take a bit to familiarize myself.

### Day 86: ###

**Progress:** Created first Vue component via injection

**Thoughts:** Eh. 


### Day 97: ###

**Progress:** Redux works now

**Thoughts:** Took a few times to try it out


### Day 98: ### 

**Progress:** Was able to get RSVP to change style in Redux 

**Thoughts:** Now I just gotta handle the spots to decrease


### Day 99: ###

**Progress:** So Props doesn't update at all and the spots stay the same because every time the _onPressFunction_ is dispatched in the store, it takes the same amount of spots fetched from data object, that's why it stays the same. 

**Thoughts:** I guess this is where React hooks come into play

### Day 100: ###

**Progress:** Finally able to wire all the components for the event drill in. Spots and attendees are now functional when click RSVP 

**Thoughts:** Feels good
