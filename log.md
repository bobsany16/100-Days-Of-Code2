### Day 47 ###

**Today's Progress:** Completed my ticket for Code:Buffalo Hackathon @home's project with my team developing a chat targeted to let people explore biases and prejudices by confronting these beliefs head on. 

**Thoughts:** while I was able to complete the tasks I set for myself, I couldn't help feeling like this whole thing wasn't cut out for me. Had a lot of questions regarding this career path and where I'll end up. I try to have hope.

### Day 54 - 56 ###

**Progress:** I've been sleeping less than 6 hours this 2 weeks in preparing for Code:Buffalo Hackathon @Home by 43North. It was worth it.

**Thoughts:** Would love to get started on storybook or learn more javaScript

### Day 75 - 78: ###

**Thoughts:** Weekends are for rest only, do not do intense work.

### Day 79: ###

**Progress:** Finally got the Header component done. Still need to figure out how to put the shadow in there.

### Day 82: ###

**Progress:** Got to do a lot of Storybook recently and learning about React components and stuffs. Truly useful!

### Day 83: ###

**Progress:** Lack of sleep for a couple nights has left me unmotivated but I pushed through with some freeCodeCamp's 
React lessons

**Thoughts:** Trying to re-establish a healthy sleep/work-schedule has been hard but I believe I'll make it happen

### Day 84: ###

**Progress:** In an attempt to learn more about React components, I decided to create a mock design of my.sbu.edu. 

**Thoughts:** Skeleton created, now I just need to go on and populate the site.

### Day 85: ###

**Progress:** Made some stylings in mySBUMock via module.css and global.css files. 

**Thoughts:** Stylings in React is a bit weird for me, it'll probably take a bit to familiarize myself.

### Day 86: ###

**Progress:** Set up BurnerBlack, after dealing with errors for hours, I got it up and running

**Thoughts:** Laying out the tasks needed to be done during the day is very helpful in keeping me disciplined.

**Progress:** Tried to figure out why the goBack navigation doesn't work

**Thoughts:** I can be so lazy I hate myself

**Thoughts:** Took a few times to try it out


### Day 98: ### 

**Progress:** Was able to get RSVP to change style in Redux 

**Thoughts:** Now I just gotta handle the spots to decrease


### Day 99: ###

**Progress:** So Props doesn't update at all and the spots stay the same because every time the _onPressFunction_ is dispatched in the store, it takes the same amount of spots fetched from data object, that's why it stays the same. 

**Thoughts:** I guess this is where React hooks come into play

### Day 100: ###

**Progress:** Finally able to wire all the components for the event drill in. Spots and attendees are now functional when click RSVP 

**Thoughts:** Feels good

**Progress:** Got some things done for Burner Black

**Thoughts:** I need to learn more about this stuff

### Day 2: ###

**Progress:** Had to re-structure my data for Burner Black, this might have made me do more work 

**Thoughts:** I like it

### Day 3: ###

**Progress:** The change in structure sort of reverses everything that I did

**Thoughts:** this is annoying

### Day 4 - 11: ###

**Progress:** Finally took care of how to handle the change in structures and now everything is functional - ish

**Thoughts:** I need to work harder at reviewing my own code before pushing to MR!!

### Day 12: ###

**Progress:** cleaned up code

**Thoughts:** afternoon's work share better be goood. 


### Day 13: ###

**Progress:** Kept working on work project so haven't had time to work on side project. Finally resumed some freeCodeCamp module today

**Thoughts:** discipline is something I lack right now


### Day 14: ###

**Progress:** Been working on completing JS module in freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** ugh


### Day 15: ###

**Progress:** sorta having an unproductive day so far. These components and nest levels are very hard to grasp

**Thoughts:** ughhhh

### Day 16: ###

**Progress:** Made some significant-ish progress on Personal Details page

**Thoughts:** Management

### Day 17: ###

**Progress:** Able to generalized the `onSubmitEditing()` for some of the input text field blocks. Still need to figure out the others for DOB, email format, phone format. 

**Thoughts:** Iss cute or whateva


### Day 18: ###

**Progress:** Styled-component wasn't working for Next.js so switched to usual stylings stuff

**Thoughts:** eh

### Day 19: ###

**Progress:** Styled some more basic components,

**Thoughts:** Gotta figure out more options within the SubHeading component.

### Day 20: ###

**Progress:** Figured out how to change the border bottom to Orange when active. Use `onFocus()` to basically highlight the text fields and `onBlur()` to un-highlight the text fields so the `isActive` props is changed to `true`

**Thoughts:** bleh, wish I knew this sooner, spent a whole day on it too

### Day 21:### 

**Progress:** Made some progress for Doron Tadmor's website. Gotta find a better way to style components without using `styledComponent`

**Thoughts:** it's aight


### Day 22: ###

**Progress:** Save button works on personal detail page

**Thoughts:** that was something else, tbh

### Day 23: ###

**Progress:** Literally just looked at code all day and that's it

**Thoughts:** eh


### Day 24: ###

### Day 25: ###

**Progress:** homepage for Doron is done for mobile-first 

**Thoughts:** design resumé page first

### Day 26: ###

**Progress:** no further progress on Doron's page but some significant progress at work. Merged Sean's branch and failed to figure out why Navigation package wasn't transpiling. 

**Thoughts:** Messy

### Day 27: ###

**Progress:** `NavBar` component had a massive syntax error in there, hence the whole `navigation` package just would not transpile. After fixing these errors, it transpiled like crazy. Finally got the whole thing to run. Redux initial state of `fetching` prop is still weird, 

**Thoughts:** beautiful


### Day 28: ### 

**Progress:** merged the thompson's work and everything ran first try! Very surprising! 

**THoughts:** If only everyday were like today

### Day 29: ###

**Progress:** Made significant work on Doron's website today
